# DogSwap

This is the first PoC of the DogSwap DEX. 

## Information

I have been trying to get this working for over a year now, and been running onto issue after issue.
This time, i finally managed to get everything to work without throwing exceptions or errors.
I am not a coder, as you can see, and designwise i'm not the best either but it's working okay? :D
