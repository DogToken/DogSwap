## Vulnerability Management Process

The project has a defined vulnerability management process for handling security issues:

- New vulnerabilities are triaged by the security team and assessed for impact and exploitability. High risks are prioritized for fixing.

- Fixes are developed to address the vulnerability without introducing regressions. This may include backporting fixes to older supported versions.

- Patches are tested before being rolled out to customers. Disclosures are coordinated with external stakeholders if needed.

- Announcements are made regarding the vulnerability to increase awareness. Users of impacted versions are notified.

## Security Communications

In addition to reporting vulnerabilities, please reach out to security@example.com for:

- Questions or concerns about security policies and practices

- Requests for security reviews or audits of systems and architecture
